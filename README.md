# Bookmark Hotbar Manager - Chrome Extension

**Making bookmark management actually sane**

## Description

Ever felt frustrated when your bookmark bar is cluttered with links from different projects? I created this extension because I was tired of constantly reorganizing my bookmarks when switching between work tasks.

Bookmark Hotbar Manager lets you create and switch between different sets of bookmarks with a click. Think of it like having multiple browser profiles without the hassle - just the bookmarks change.

## What it does

- Save different bookmark bar layouts for different contexts (work projects, clients, personal stuff)
- Switch your entire bookmark bar instantly to match what you're working on right now
- Find your saved sets quickly with a search that works as you type
- Create new bookmark sets on the fly

## Who it's for

If you're a developer juggling multiple projects, each with their own docs, repos, and tools - this is for you.

If you're an office worker who needs different resources for different clients or tasks - this will make your day easier.

Basically, if you've ever thought "I wish I could have different bookmark bars for different parts of my life" - that's exactly what this solves.

## How it works (the simple version)

The extension creates and manages bookmark sets in your "Other Bookmarks" folder. When you switch sets, it swaps out your current bookmarks with the ones from your chosen set. Nothing complicated, just a smart way to organize what you already use.

No need to manually reorganize your bookmark bar ever again. No more hunting through nested folders to find that one link you need.

This is the bookmark manager I always wanted but couldn't find - so I built it. I hope it makes your work life a little bit easier too.
